## Running locally

dotnet run<br>
(compiles the application and launches it on http://localhost:56075)

## Publishing

dotnet publish<br>
dotnet ./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/publish/razor-pages.dll<br>
https://localhost:5001<br>
You should see the same application as before, but now as an optimized version.
